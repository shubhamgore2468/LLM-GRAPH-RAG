       "  'reviews': ['Upgraded from my iPhone 11 that was suffering due to poor battery health after many years of use. Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature. The phone came with a charger as well. The camera takes really great quality photos as well (Picture of the pink rose is the iPhone 15’s camera quality). You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I’m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple. After my experience shopping for this new phone I would consider buying a refurbished device in the future with Amazon again as well. Such a great deal for a new phone.Read more',\n",

       "   \"The older ipads required me to use the cloud service to switch devices, that is no longer the case.. Also I hate cloud services cause they are a security risk as if anyone hacks your cloud service account, they get everything you have there, its not a good idea..  This is my moms new ipad cause her old Ipad Air 2 battery bit the dust.. I asked gemini how much faster this one was and it said 2 to 2.5 times faster than my 6th gen ipad, but the ipad air 2's I think it said the ipad air 2s are 5 times slower than the A13's..  For the record , I have a quest 3 VR headset and Gemini said its performance is on par with a M! or M2 processor, and the Quest 3 is designed for VR/AR applications whereas the ipads are not.. I have noticed in web browser performance the Quest 3 is super fast.. IT was question cause I use USIO and the V1.5 update of the Web Interface is super sluggish on my 6th gen ipad..  According to Gemini the A14 is 20% faster.. And the M1 is significant;y faster, like a 100-200% speed up.. But you can ask Gemini about that stuff.  The Quest 3 I have is the 512GB model, its about $800.. So if youa re thinking about the Vision Pro, my opinion is to wait until its proved itself, the Quest 3 roughly the same performance, and you will have to get all new apps for the vision pro to use VR, the Quest 3 is all vr..Anyhow back to the A13 based ipad here.. To install it all we had to do is take the old iPAd Air 2 with ios 9 I think it was.. and hover it over the new ipad, the new ipad had this starfield in a sphere that was moving. I also had top enable the bluetooth on the old ipad.. IT took in all about 10 minutes to setup, and didn't require password access, it only use the pin and touch to setup.. It would first connect via bluetooth, possibly using a Asymmetric KEy encryption like your web browser, thats is a foolproof way of connecting devices over untrusted networks.. They will then exchance a symmetrixc key which is impossible to hack, the asymmetric is is more impossible but it requires a lot more processing power thats why its only used for the initial handshake to setup the connection. Asymmetric keys cannot be used without both ends of the connection having the same key, and if you passed that over without a secure connection, it would be dead easy to decrypt. If it wasn't for Asymmetric key encryption business would not be possible on the Internet. Well I take that back, asymmetric key encryption combined with a certificate server which validates the connection between both parties to prevent middle man attacks, is necessary for business on the net.. Anyhow you can tell I'm a brainiac..It really only required hand holding for me to install this pad.. My mom is easily intimidated.. But I'm sure she could have done it on her own talking to some telephone support from appl if it came to that. But cause I'm in the same house, it was easier for her..The screen seemed larger than her old Ipad Air 2.. She has two of those, one only has 16GBs on it.. I decided I need one myself,so I got the exact same model to replace my 6th gen iPad.. The screen scale is larger than our old iPads.. So it should berefreshing to use..

       "   'This is a great little device. We needed a tablet that could run zoom and \"virtual learning\" things more smoothly than our daughter\\'s fire tablet. We were also looking for something she can play Roblox on without all the glitches that comes with Fire tablets. We found this on sale for the same price as a Fire 10 which seemed like a steal, so we went ahead and got it. I am very glad, because it just runs a lot more smoothly in general than fire tablets (which is the only other type we\\'ve had for her). It seems to charge at a decent speed, and the battery holds for several days. Although she doesn\\'t use it very frequently during the week so maybe if she used it more, it wouldn\\'t last as long.I will say shipping took forever. It was supposed to be a 1 week ship and it got delayed and took 2 weeks.Also, a notice for android users: It was really hard for me to set up for a kids tablet. I do love that there are kid setting options, but setting it up was very confusing for me, as an android user. And thank goodness my wife is an apple girly, because it seems like it would be very hard to navigate the kids side on the parent account without another apple device. I am the tech setter-upper in the house, and I\\'m sure this was user error, but I ended up having to go through all my wife\\'s accounts to set it up rather than my own. Also (in case you\\'re not used to apples), it seems like you cannot set it up for an adult and then add the child account onto the same device, like you would be able to for a Fire. It has to solely be set up for that child and then managed on a second apple device.Overall it works very well, looks shnazzy, serves all our purposes, and was a great price.Read more',\n",

       "   'Review de uso por 2 meses:- A tela dele é muito linda, macia ao toque, ele é rápido, é leve, é grande mas confortável. Ótimo pra estudar, pra ver série, fazer pesquisa. Os 64 GB de espaço dá pra usar tranquilo por muito tempo sem precisar apagar arquivos. Eu substituí o meu iPad Air 1ª Geração de 2014 com 16 GB de espaço que usei desde 2014 mesmo, e a diferença pra esse modelo aqui é ABSURDA!- A bateria dura bastante. Como eu uso muito o iPad, eu tenho que recarregá-lo a cada 2 dias. Isso porque eu uso Instagram, Twitter, Podcasts, HBO Max, Prime Video, YouTube e aplicativos de notas para estudo na faculdade (além de pesquisas no Safari). O sistema diz que eu tenho uma média de 7h de uso diário. O recarregamento é muito rápido, vai de 10% a 100% em 40min~1h. Isso pra mim é rápido. Só recarrego novamente 2 dias depois. Pra mim dá muita segurança de que não me deixa na mão.- Eu não tenho a Apple Pencil porque é MUITO cara, então comprei uma da GooJoDoq 12ª geração no Al1expr3ss, foi 94 reais, e ela é perfeita! É perfeito pra escrever. Única coisa que só a Apple Pencil tem é a sensibilidade de pressão. Quem for artista ou tiver objetivo de um iPad para desenho, talvez a falta de sensor de pressão para a caneta GooJoDoq faça diferença, então terá que comprar a Apple Pencil mesmo. Para mim, não faz diferença e a caneta é realmente MUITO boa.- A câmera é boa, mas tem um filtro típico da Apple que não me agrada muito, deixa a cara um pouco lavada. Porém a tecnologia de Palco Central e desfoque do fundo nativo são realmente muito bons. Dá um aspecto mais profissional em ligações por vídeos. Os microfones também são excelentes, dando opções para isolamento de voz, que retira todo o ruído em volta e foca só na sua voz. É incrível isso.- Um ponto negativo desse iPad é o sensor de pressão digital não ser muito rápido e só funcionar com a tela acordada. Então você tem que apertar um botão pra ligar a tela e então colocar o dedo no sensor pra desbloquear. É uma inconveniência, que dentro de todas as qualidades desse iPad eu acho que é só um grão na areia.- Por fim, eu paguei 2700 em Março/2022, pela loja Tech Play Store. Recomendo a loja, a entrega foi rápida e o iPad é realmente novo, lacrado, com garantia oficial no site da Apple.Read more',\n",

I am the tech setter-upper in the house, and I'm sure this was user error, but I ended up having to go through all my wife's accounts to set it up rather than my own. Also (in case you're not used to apples), it seems like you cannot set it up for an adult and then add the child account onto the same device, like you would be able to for a Fire. It has to solely be set up for that child and then managed on a second apple device.Overall it works very well, looks shnazzy, serves all our purposes, and was a great price.Read more I needed something' metadata={'product': 'Apple iPad (9th'}\n",

    "#             'My wife have been contemplating getting a new iPhone because hers had reached the capacity on storage and the battery was not keeping a long charge. I think she had the iPhone 8. We ARE NOT a couple that splurge because finances dictate that we be humble. So when I was searching for a phone I was looking at the iPhone 11 or 12. But knowing the 15 was out and it got crazy praise I called our local Apple store for advice. The gentleman told me the 11 would be a huge upgrade from the 8 that she had. But he said with the 15 she would have all the latest technology AND she wouldnt have to upgrade for at least 4 yrs considering she had the 8 for 3 yrs and we bought that the end of 2020. So I took a deep breath, came to my saved items on prime and purchased this \"refurbished\" iPhone 15. Im GenX. I came up when the Nokia, Sony Erickson, Motorola RAZR (the grey flat one) and Nextel were wassup. So spending a G on a phone was a HARD NO for me. But this time I said EFF IT. This phone was brand new, works flawlessly, its everything she ever wanted from her old phone. Were on Verizon but the phone came unlocked. It took a little long because the phone needed an Apple update but after an hour it was up and running. So if youre on the fence about getting this \"refurbished\" iPhone 15 Pro Max because of condition, functionality or network issues dont be. Our experience was great',\n",

Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature.

You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I’m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple.

I have noticed in web browser performance the Quest 3 is super fast.. IT was question cause I use USIO and the V1.5 update of the Web Interface is super sluggish on my 6th gen ipad..  According to Gemini the A14 is 20% faster.. And the M1 is significant;y faster, like a 100-200% speed up.. But you can ask Gemini about that stuff.  The Quest 3 I have is the 512GB model, its about $800..

It would first connect via bluetooth, possibly using a Asymmetric KEy encryption like your web browser, thats is a foolproof way of connecting devices over untrusted networks.. They will then exchance a symmetrixc key which is impossible to hack, the asymmetric is is more impossible but it requires a lot more processing power thats why its only used for the initial handshake to setup the connection. Asymmetric keys cannot be used without both ends of the connection having the same key, and if you passed that over without a secure connection, it would be dead easy to decrypt. If it wasn't for Asymmetric key encryption business would not be possible on the Internet. Well I take that back, asymmetric key encryption combined with a certificate server which validates the connection between both parties to prevent middle man attacks, is necessary for business on the net..

But I'm sure she could have done it on her own talking to some telephone support from appl if it came to that.

Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature. The phone came with a charger as well. The camera takes really great quality photos as well (Picture of the pink rose is the iPhone 15’s camera quality). You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I’m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple. After my experience shopping for this new phone I would consider buying a refurbished device in the future with Amazon again as well. Such a great deal for a new phone.Read more I ordered this phone back in April/may and I do not regret it one bit! It works great and the color is really pretty the camera quality is good too.

After researching renewed options from different sites this option came up as the best priced for the best quality. I’ve bought renewed items before from others sellers / companies and have had issues, so I was a little nervous. When the phone arrived I was shocked at the quality. It looked brand new. No scratches or any issues at all. I will never buy a brand new phone again when I can buy it for half the price for the same quality.

Also I hate cloud services cause they are a security risk as if anyone hacks your cloud service account, they get everything you have there, its not a good idea..  This is my moms new ipad cause her old Ipad Air 2 battery bit the dust.. I asked gemini how much faster this one was and it said 2 to 2.5 times faster than my 6th gen ipad, but the ipad air 2's I think it said the ipad air 2s are 5 times slower than the A13's..  For the record , I have a quest 3 VR headset and Gemini said its performance is on par with a M! or M2 processor, and the Quest 3 is designed for VR/AR applications whereas the ipads are not.. I have noticed in web browser performance the Quest 3 is super fast.. IT was question cause I use USIO and the V1.5 update of the Web Interface is super sluggish on my 6th gen ipad..  According to Gemini the A14 is 20% faster.. And the M1 is significant;y faster, like a 100-200% speed up.. But you can ask Gemini about that stuff.  The Quest 3 I have is the 512GB model, its about $800.. So if youa re thinking about the Vision Pro, my opinion is to wait until its proved itself, the Quest 3 roughly the same performance, and you will have to get all new apps for the vision pro to use VR, the Quest 3 is all vr..Anyhow back to the A13 based ipad here..

It would first connect via bluetooth, possibly using a Asymmetric KEy encryption like your web browser, thats is a foolproof way of connecting devices over untrusted networks.. They will then exchance a symmetrixc key which is impossible to hack, the asymmetric is is more impossible but it requires a lot more processing power thats why its only used for the initial handshake to setup the connection. Asymmetric keys cannot be used without both ends of the connection having the same key, and if you passed that over without a secure connection, it would be dead easy to decrypt. If it wasn't for Asymmetric key encryption business would not be possible on the Internet. Well I take that back, asymmetric key encryption combined with a certificate server which validates the connection between both parties to prevent middle man attacks, is necessary for business on the net..

I am very glad, because it just runs a lot more smoothly in general than fire tablets (which is the only other type we\\'ve had for her). It seems to charge at a decent speed, and the battery holds for several days. Although she doesn\\'t use it very frequently during the week so maybe if she used it more, it wouldn\\'t last as long.I will say shipping took forever. It was supposed to be a 1 week ship and it got delayed and took 2 weeks.Also, a notice for android users: It was really hard for me to set up for a kids tablet. I do love that there are kid setting options, but setting it up was very confusing for me, as an android user. And thank goodness my wife is an apple girly, because it seems like it would be very hard to navigate the kids side on the parent account without another apple device. I am the tech setter-upper in the house, and I\\'m sure this was user error, but I ended up having to go through all my wife\\'s accounts to set it up rather than my own. Also (in case you\\'re not used to apples), it seems like you cannot set it up for an adult and then add the child account onto the same device, like you would be able to for a Fire. It has to solely be set up for that child and then managed on a second apple device.Overall it works very well, looks shnazzy, serves all our purposes, and was a great price.Read more I needed something')),\n",

Ótimo pra estudar, pra ver série, fazer pesquisa. Os 64 GB de espaço dá pra usar tranquilo por muito tempo sem precisar apagar arquivos. Eu substituí o meu iPad Air 1ª Geração de 2014 com 16 GB de espaço que usei desde 2014 mesmo, e a diferença pra esse modelo aqui é ABSURDA!- A bateria dura bastante. Como eu uso muito o iPad, eu tenho que recarregá-lo a cada 2 dias. Isso porque eu uso Instagram, Twitter, Podcasts, HBO Max, Prime Video, YouTube e aplicativos de notas para estudo na faculdade (além de pesquisas no Safari). O sistema d')),\n",

Pra mim dá muita segurança de que não me deixa na mão.- Eu não tenho a Apple Pencil porque é MUITO cara, então comprei uma da GooJoDoq 12ª geração no Al1expr3ss, foi 94 reais, e ela é perfeita! É perfeito pra escrever. Única coisa que só a Apple Pencil tem é a sensibilidade de pressão. Quem for artista ou tiver objetivo de um iPad para desenho, talvez a falta de sensor de pressão para a caneta GooJoDoq faça diferença, então terá que comprar a Apple Pencil mesmo. Para mim, não faz diferença e a caneta é realmente MUITO boa.- A câmera é boa, mas tem um filtro típico da Apple que não me agrada muito, deixa a cara um pouco lavada. Porém a tecnologia de Palco Central e desfoque do fundo nativo são realmente muito bons. Dá um aspecto mais profissional em ligações por vídeos. Os microfones também são excelentes, dando opções para isolamento de voz, que retira todo o ruído em volta e foca só na sua voz. É incrível isso.- Um ponto negativo desse iPad é o sensor de pressão digital não ser muito rápido e só funcionar com a tela acordada. Então você tem que apertar um')),\n",
