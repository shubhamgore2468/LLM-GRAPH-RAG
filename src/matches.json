  "KS   A must-have   Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024   Style: 6 CountSize: 2-25 lbsVerified Purchase   Summer is always the worst for my dog when it comes to fleas, especially living in a dog-friendly apartment complex. My senior dog constantly picks up fleas, and all I want is for her to be comfortable. Capstar has been a savior! It works fast, I can see a difference. It\u2019s become a regular part of my dog\u2019s care routine, and it keeps her flea-free and comfortable. I highly recommend it for anyone dealing with flea issues, especially if you want a quick, effective solution.   3 people found this helpful   Helpful   Report",
  "Joseph Marcotte   Effective Flea Treatment, Needs Price Adjustment   Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024   Style: 6 CountSize: Over 25 lbsVerified Purchase   This product has been what I was looking for in terms of flea treatment. It's effective and fast acting - just as promised on the packaging. It starts killing fleas in 30 minutes, which is a relief for my dog. However, I believe the price could be a bit more affordable. It's worth it for the speed and effectiveness, but the cost might be a barrier for some pet owners. Despite the price, I would still recommend it to others who are battling with a flea problem.   7 people found this helpful   Helpful   Report",
  "jennifer davis   Worked Great   Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024   Style: 12 CountSize: Over 25 lbsVerified Purchase   I have 2 dogs that got fleas, these worked great. It started killing the flea\u2019s with in 30 minutes after I gave them the pills. I wish it killed the eggs too and not just the adult fleas but I will take it.. You will need to vacuum your home (I vacuumed everyday for 2 weeks) and I washed/cleaned all bedding and toys. I also sprayed my yard. I did end up giving my dogs another pill 3 days after the first pill just to make sure..   3 people found this helpful   Helpful   Report",
  "Kimberly W.   Didn't work at all for Alaskan Malamutes   Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2023   Style: 6 CountSize: Over 25 lbsVerified Purchase   First, let me point out that CapStar is NOT a preventative! It is supposed to kill adult fleas on the dog but it doesn't prevent them from getting fleas again - not does it kill anything but adult fleas, which means you still need something (monthly topical or oral flea medicine) to kill the eggs and the larvae or those will obviously mature into adults and you and your pet are stuck in the vicious cycle.      That being said, here is my first and only experience with CapStar. We have never had flea issues until this year. I have two Alaskan Malamutes - one 105 pound \"short hair\" and one 110 pound long hair. Clearly, they both have the Malamute thick double coat. We usually like K9 Advantix II for flea treatment/prevention. Early this summer, I bought the Amazon brand that has the same ingredients. As K9 Advantix Ii. It arrived with no expiration date and I'm not sure if that's the reason that it doesn't seem to work, that it's not the same formula or perhaps the fleas have become resistant... or it's just an especially overwhelming year for fleas. Either way, I thought by trying this first and THEN putting their prevention on within a day or two would work. I gave them each a CapStar pill, nervously watched for adverse reactions and thanked God they didn't seem to have any issues. It also didn't seem to help the flea situation - they continued scratching and biting as before. Because I didn't want to give them back to back, I waited for about 48 hours before giving another CapStar to each of them. Once again, no reaction but the scratching and chewing hasn't subsided at all nine hours later. In fact, I almost feel like both times, they are actually scratching more after the CapStar tablets?? It makes me wonder if it is actually not killing the fleas but just irritating them and making them more active and angry (or at least more hungry LOL). I really needed this to work and was hoping that in conjunction with a topical preventative, we would be able to both kill AND prevent reinfstation with a two prong attack. Sadly, we are just out more money, time and effort.      I should mention that a long side this effort, I treated the bedrooms that have carpet (the rest of the house has hard floors and we have a no-knap, outdoor rug I'm the living room because it can be power washed) Anyway, I sprayed the Vet's Best Flea & Tick Home Spray on the carpet, mattresses and washed bedding & blankets. It's difficult to get every possible location that a flea could be hiding but I was fortunate to be able to see a flea and spray directly on it. The Vet's Best spray killed it in less than 10 seconds. It does say that you can apply it to your dog's coat and rub it in down to their skin. That sounded too unrealistic with their thick coats but because it is natural, smells really nice IMO and obviously works, I think I will still attempt that on most of their cost/body, add Diatomaceous Earth to the floors, dog beds, rugs, etc and THEN try reapplying topical prevention. I just have to decide of I am going to use some of the 8 tubes I have left of the Amazon brand or try something else - might pick up the Frontline Plus that's on sale at Costco tomorrow.

  "Deborah   Efficient, No-Frills Flea Treatment   Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2024   Style: 6 CountSize: 2-25 lbsVerified Purchase   I've been using this brand for a couple of years now and it's been a game changer. This flea treatment is affordable and easy to administer. What I love the most is that it leaves no mess or residue. It doesn't even require a vet prescription, so it's very convenient. It's also safe for my small dogs and puppies, which is a big plus. All in all, it's been very effective in controlling fleas, and I no longer need to buy different products for my various-sized dogs. Highly recommend it!   5 people found this helpful   Helpful   Report",
  "Jenell Wagner   Quick and Easy Flea Solution for My Dog   Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024   Style: 6 CountSize: Over 25 lbsVerified Purchase   I love the fact that this product is really easy to administer.
