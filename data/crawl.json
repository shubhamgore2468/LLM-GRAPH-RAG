            "For my uses this phone is a great deal.  I use it as a phone, for email, to text, to access the internet, for Zoom, to navigate, to take photos, and a bunch of lesser things like controlling my alarm system and thermometer, reading the Washington Post etc.  What I don\u2019t do is game and social media.The most important things I want in a phone are that it does what I need, which it does, and that it be stable and robust \u2013 it\u2019s a Samsung -- nuf said.I had been using a Samsung Galaxy J7 for the past five years but finally decided that it just didn\u2019t have enough memory so I got the A15 which has about 4x more memory and seems perfectly adequate.  Aside from inadequate memory, my old J7 worked perfectly and still does.I see some complaints about the A15 being slow.  It seems fine for my uses, but you\u2019ve probably guessed by now that I\u2019m not exactly a tech expert, power user type.  I can tell you that videos and Zoom operate smoothly.  It may not work very well for high demand functions like gaming, but I wouldn\u2019t know.I opted for the US version for $200 rather than the international version for $20 or $30 less because I didn\u2019t want to mess around with any possible compatibility issues with my cell service provider.  Speaking of cost: for my uses, why would I spend 4 to 6 times more for a high-end phone -- really?The battery seems fine.  I let it charge at night but it so far has never gone below 80% during an average day\u2019s use.  The screen is large and sharp and the cameras seem to do a fine job.  I could only wish that it was smaller and lighter and that it had cordless charging but for the price I\u2019m not complaining.FYI:  The phone weighs 7.57 oz (0.47lbs) and the dimensions are 6 \u00bc\u201d  x  3\u201dRead more",
            "Great phone for under $200, I use this for school at home, and in public, honestly, it's got great performance, and new features being added. This is a great budget for those who want a phone that is working very well, has great performance for your needs, great battery life, and new updates to enhance the security and privacy of your phone.Read more",
            "I bought this for my son and so fat in two weeks he loves it. Battery life is longer than advertised. He charges it every 3 days or so. Loves watching crisp videos and playing video games. Fingerprint sensor works every-time so far. Sound is louder than my iphone 14 pro. Love the option for a wired headphone, there is also the option for bluetooth accessories. Lots of phone cases available for this model. Reason for three starts? Well there is some lag speed with having multiple apps open.Read more",
            "I had an LG Stylo 5 but it was old and I found out they were going to face them out. So I decided to buy a Samsung Galaxy A15. I had several Samsung's in the past and had always loved them. So I decided that's what I was going to get.  WRONG CHOICE!!! . This is the worst phone that I have ever had!!! Didn't have it two months until the screen cracked. Things such as alarms turn will  off and on as they please. And when I do have them set they don't go off. Apps come and go as they please. Things appear on your screen that you cannot get off! You can put it on do not disturb and set it to do not turn off until I say so. Well it turns off when IT says so!! I will have things on my phone and try to go back to it Well guess what it's been wiped out.  I will be right in the middle of something and it will knock me out and then not let me back in. This happens all the time. I can't believe all this is happening with the Samsung. I mean this phone is horrible horrible!!!!! Buyer Beware!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT HALF A STAR IF I COULD HAVE. NEVER AGAIN WHILE I BUY A SAMSUNG.Read more",
            "I've always purchased budget phones and my TCL 30 SE phone battery swelled up and cracked the back of the case off. So decided to give the Samsung Galaxy A15 phone a try. I like the build quality of the phone it feels solid and with 5g data and amoled display it's worth the price. It has everything I want in a phone. I don't open a lot of web page tabs so it fast enough for me. It's the four years of Android upgrades that sold me on this phone. My last phone didn't last two years before the battery problem. I hope this phone last long enough to receive all the Android upgrade. The power button is a little hard to press, but the fingerprint sensor works great. I really like this phone and highly recommend this budget phone.Note::Taking a screenshot is difficult because you have to press the power button and the volume down button at same time. The power is so sunken down in the frame you have to use both hands which sucks. Put the feature in the drop down menu bar like other phones.Read more",
            "This isn't a flagship phone but very adequate for the price tag. The screen is a little slow but it may be due to screen protector. Provides everything I need for a really great priceRead more",
            "Yes it works, but I have complaints! The touch-screen is the biggest problem, it is unresponsive and inexact. VERY INEXACT. The battery life is pretty good, but not as good as my Moto-G. And it gets really bad call reception in my area if it's not set to wi-fi calling. I do live in a very remote location, but still, what the heck? My old phone worked! My husband's phone works! It's a phone, shouldn't its primary function be making and receiving calls? (Oh, I just betrayed my age, didn't I?)That's all my complaints. Those caveats aside, it has good smartphone functionality and it's sturdy. It is also extremely affordable.I'm afraid I had high expectations. Because they are the premier Android brand, I expected a low-level Samsung to be at least as good as a mid-level Motorola. NO. That is NOT the case. I will be going back to a Moto-G when this phone reaches the end of its usefulness. And I will try to take better care of the next one!Read more"
