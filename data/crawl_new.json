            "Upgraded from my iPhone 11 that was suffering due to poor battery health after many years of use. Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature. The phone came with a charger as well. The camera takes really great quality photos as well (Picture of the pink rose is the iPhone 15\u2019s camera quality). You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I\u2019m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple. After my experience shopping for this new phone I would consider buying a refurbished device in the future with Amazon again as well. Such a great deal for a new phone.Read more",

            "I never review however am highly impressed with this product. I recently broke my iPhone 15 and refused to buy the same phone for the same price at apple. After researching renewed options from different sites this option came up as the best priced for the best quality. I\u2019ve bought renewed items before from others sellers / companies and have had issues, so I was a little nervous. When the phone arrived I was shocked at the quality. It looked brand new. No scratches or any issues at all. I will never buy a brand new phone again when I can buy it for half the price for the same quality. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE / PRODUCTRead more",
            "I got this phone as an upgrade from an XR I had gotten refurbished- but this 15 is almost brand new! It\u2019s only had one cycle before and was first used in July!Other than a tiny scratch on the screen that I can\u2019t really see other than from a certain angle- the phone is perfect! Great valueRead more",

            "The older ipads required me to use the cloud service to switch devices, that is no longer the case.. Also I hate cloud services cause they are a security risk as if anyone hacks your cloud service account, they get everything you have there, its not a good idea..  This is my moms new ipad cause her old Ipad Air 2 battery bit the dust.. I asked gemini how much faster this one was and it said 2 to 2.5 times faster than my 6th gen ipad, but the ipad air 2's I think it said the ipad air 2s are 5 times slower than the A13's..  For the record , I have a quest 3 VR headset and Gemini said its performance is on par with a M! or M2 processor, and the Quest 3 is designed for VR/AR applications whereas the ipads are not.. I have noticed in web browser performance the Quest 3 is super fast.. IT was question cause I use USIO and the V1.5 update of the Web Interface is super sluggish on my 6th gen ipad..  According to Gemini the A14 is 20% faster.. And the M1 is significant;y faster, like a 100-200% speed up.. But you can ask Gemini about that stuff.  The Quest 3 I have is the 512GB model, its about $800.. So if youa re thinking about the Vision Pro, my opinion is to wait until its proved itself, the Quest 3 roughly the same performance, and you will have to get all new apps for the vision pro to use VR, the Quest 3 is all vr..Anyhow back to the A13 based ipad here.. To install it all we had to do is take the old iPAd Air 2 with ios 9 I think it was.. and hover it over the new ipad, the new ipad had this starfield in a sphere that was moving. I also had top enable the bluetooth on the old ipad.. IT took in all about 10 minutes to setup, and didn't require password access, it only use the pin and touch to setup.. It would first connect via bluetooth, possibly using a Asymmetric KEy encryption like your web browser, thats is a foolproof way of connecting devices over untrusted networks.. They will then exchance a symmetrixc key which is impossible to hack, the asymmetric is is more impossible but it requires a lot more processing power thats why its only used for the initial handshake to setup the connection. Asymmetric keys cannot be used without both ends of the connection having the same key, and if you passed that over without a secure connection, it would be dead easy to decrypt. If it wasn't for Asymmetric key encryption business would not be possible on the Internet. Well I take that back, asymmetric key encryption combined with a certificate server which validates the connection between both parties to prevent middle man attacks, is necessary for business on the net.. Anyhow you can tell I'm a brainiac..It really only required hand holding for me to install this pad.. My mom is easily intimidated.. But I'm sure she could have done it on her own talking to some telephone support from appl if it came to that. But cause I'm in the same house, it was easier for her..The screen seemed larger than her old Ipad Air 2.. She has two of those, one only has 16GBs on it.. I decided I need one myself,so I got the exact same model to replace my 6th gen iPad.. The screen scale is larger than our old iPads.. So it should berefreshing to use.. It also said something about reduced glare, and Apple gen 1 pencil support, which makes it great for artists, giving it tilt and pressure support.. But I'm a AI guy, so I prompt everything..Read more",
            "Last year, I bought iPads as birthday gifts for my nephews, and I\u2019m thrilled to say they\u2019re still in great condition\u2014no broken parts at all! They\u2019ve been able to use them for everything from playing games to doing their class work, and they\u2019ve really made the most of them. The best part is that they fit well within my budget, offering excellent value without breaking the bank. Plus, they\u2019re not outdated; I chose the 9th generation model, which is still relatively new and perfect for their needs. Overall, it was a great investment!Read more",
            "I\u2019ve been using something else to stream content but saw the great deal on this and went for it. It\u2019s a great device. The streaming is solid. It\u2019s great to have my Apple apps. The internet browser is so much faster than what I was using.  All around terrific device.Read more",
            "This is a great little device. We needed a tablet that could run zoom and \"virtual learning\" things more smoothly than our daughter's fire tablet. We were also looking for something she can play Roblox on without all the glitches that comes with Fire tablets. We found this on sale for the same price as a Fire 10 which seemed like a steal, so we went ahead and got it. I am very glad, because it just runs a lot more smoothly in general than fire tablets (which is the only other type we've had for her). It seems to charge at a decent speed, and the battery holds for several days. Although she doesn't use it very frequently during the week so maybe if she used it more, it wouldn't last as long.I will say shipping took forever. It was supposed to be a 1 week ship and it got delayed and took 2 weeks.Also, a notice for android users: It was really hard for me to set up for a kids tablet. I do love that there are kid setting options, but setting it up was very confusing for me, as an android user. And thank goodness my wife is an apple girly, because it seems like it would be very hard to navigate the kids side on the parent account without another apple device. I am the tech setter-upper in the house, and I'm sure this was user error, but I ended up having to go through all my wife's accounts to set it up rather than my own. Also (in case you're not used to apples), it seems like you cannot set it up for an adult and then add the child account onto the same device, like you would be able to for a Fire. It has to solely be set up for that child and then managed on a second apple device.Overall it works very well, looks shnazzy, serves all our purposes, and was a great price.Read more",

            "I always liked using my IPad. After many years of use, it finally stopped working. When I went to search for a new one I saw the one I  bought.  It was not the newest model but for what I use it for it was perfect. I use it to hear or watch the news. Also I use it for entertainment purposes. The IPad I bought is high quality at a great price.Read more",

            "Review de uso por 2 meses:- A tela dele \u00e9 muito linda, macia ao toque, ele \u00e9 r\u00e1pido, \u00e9 leve, \u00e9 grande mas confort\u00e1vel. \u00d3timo pra estudar, pra ver s\u00e9rie, fazer pesquisa. Os 64 GB de espa\u00e7o d\u00e1 pra usar tranquilo por muito tempo sem precisar apagar arquivos. Eu substitu\u00ed o meu iPad Air 1\u00aa Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de 2014 com 16 GB de espa\u00e7o que usei desde 2014 mesmo, e a diferen\u00e7a pra esse modelo aqui \u00e9 ABSURDA!- A bateria dura bastante. Como eu uso muito o iPad, eu tenho que recarreg\u00e1-lo a cada 2 dias. Isso porque eu uso Instagram, Twitter, Podcasts, HBO Max, Prime Video, YouTube e aplicativos de notas para estudo na faculdade (al\u00e9m de pesquisas no Safari). O sistema diz que eu tenho uma m\u00e9dia de 7h de uso di\u00e1rio. O recarregamento \u00e9 muito r\u00e1pido, vai de 10% a 100% em 40min~1h. Isso pra mim \u00e9 r\u00e1pido. S\u00f3 recarrego novamente 2 dias depois. Pra mim d\u00e1 muita seguran\u00e7a de que n\u00e3o me deixa na m\u00e3o.- Eu n\u00e3o tenho a Apple Pencil porque \u00e9 MUITO cara, ent\u00e3o comprei uma da GooJoDoq 12\u00aa gera\u00e7\u00e3o no Al1expr3ss, foi 94 reais, e ela \u00e9 perfeita! \u00c9 perfeito pra escrever. \u00danica coisa que s\u00f3 a Apple Pencil tem \u00e9 a sensibilidade de press\u00e3o. Quem for artista ou tiver objetivo de um iPad para desenho, talvez a falta de sensor de press\u00e3o para a caneta GooJoDoq fa\u00e7a diferen\u00e7a, ent\u00e3o ter\u00e1 que comprar a Apple Pencil mesmo. Para mim, n\u00e3o faz diferen\u00e7a e a caneta \u00e9 realmente MUITO boa.- A c\u00e2mera \u00e9 boa, mas tem um filtro t\u00edpico da Apple que n\u00e3o me agrada muito, deixa a cara um pouco lavada. Por\u00e9m a tecnologia de Palco Central e desfoque do fundo nativo s\u00e3o realmente muito bons. D\u00e1 um aspecto mais profissional em liga\u00e7\u00f5es por v\u00eddeos. Os microfones tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o excelentes, dando op\u00e7\u00f5es para isolamento de voz, que retira todo o ru\u00eddo em volta e foca s\u00f3 na sua voz. \u00c9 incr\u00edvel isso.- Um ponto negativo desse iPad \u00e9 o sensor de press\u00e3o digital n\u00e3o ser muito r\u00e1pido e s\u00f3 funcionar com a tela acordada. Ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea tem que apertar um bot\u00e3o pra ligar a tela e ent\u00e3o colocar o dedo no sensor pra desbloquear. \u00c9 uma inconveni\u00eancia, que dentro de todas as qualidades desse iPad eu acho que \u00e9 s\u00f3 um gr\u00e3o na areia.- Por fim, eu paguei 2700 em Mar\u00e7o/2022, pela loja Tech Play Store. Recomendo a loja, a entrega foi r\u00e1pida e o iPad \u00e9 realmente novo, lacrado, com garantia oficial no site da Apple.Read more",
            "\u00d3timo produto, original, com excelente desempenho e qualidade, como quaisquer outros produtos da Apple. Pre\u00e7o muito mais em conta que outros vendedores, inclusive com rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao pr\u00f3prio site da marca. A transportadora superou as expectativas na entrega, chegando bem antes do prazo estabelecido (o que demorou foi quando passou para os Correios, mas, mesmo assim, chegou r\u00e1pido).Read more"
