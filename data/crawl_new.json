            "I usually wear a 6.5 or 7.0...I read the reviews and some thought they were too narrow and decided to go with size or 1/2 size up. I went with the size 7, and glad I did.  They did have a little extra room in the toes, but the width was perfect. I wore a heavier sock and the boots fit perfectly.  I bought the brown pair first, and decided to purchase the black pair . I already had a pair of black suede boots, and wanted to get a more waterproof boot for the wet weather, I got the leather looking ones. I wore them with my dress and pants ..and they looked good with both. They can look both dressy or casual.  I love the zipper on the inside so you can easily slip your foot into the boot. There's also a little pocket at the top inside of the boot where you can stash money or credit card. I love these boots. I was lucky to get one on sale and the other was marked down so I paid $34 for one pair and  $40 for the other pair. (I wish I had brought both pairs when they $34.)Read more",
            "As an asian with wide calves it is SO DIFFICULT to find legit wide calf boots in stores. Took a chance on this pair and I couldn't be happier. It zips up easily and holds up its structure well. I have yet to break it in but upon fitting the boot, it feels comfortable and does not pinch my toes. Excited to wear these boots for travel!Read more",
            "They are great in height and true to size, width, and color. Only downside, is they fall all the way down when you walk, so then they look like you are wearing boots that are too big. If they had a draw string or something where it could hold the boot in place once you slouch to your preference, they would be perfect.Read more",
            "I have a hard time finding boots that fit my size 12 foot and my wide calves and these work for both issues. They are very cute also.  Bonus that there is not a big heel as I am 5\u201910\u201d and do not like heels. These are great! Will be ordering a black pairRead more",
            "Was worried the calf part wouldn't be wide enough or look too wide, it just fits and looks perfect.Read more",
            "These boots are cute and the shoe size itself fits and is comfortable, but I specifically purchased these, because they were advertised as being for large/wide calves and they are not. They fit so snug it was painful and I could not get them all the way up my calf. I have very athletic/muscular legs so knee high boots have always been a struggle. I ended up cutting the \"stretch\" fabric in the back and that helped enough to make them comfortable to wear. But the stretch fabric has no give/stretch to it anyways. Otherwise, I do like these boots and I am going to keep them. I just have to wear knee high socks to assist with pulling them up, otherwise they will not come anywhere near the top of my calves.Read more",
            "These boots are beautiful, and sooo comfortable.  Love themI have 5 pairs!!!!Read more",
            "I think this is my 4th or 5th pairs of dream pairs. I have sandals, sneakers and boots with them and each one has been comfortable and all day wearable.I have crappy feet and wide calves (sexy, I know) so it's not always easy for me to find shoes and boots that are cute and comfy without spending 100s of dollars.Boots alone in wide calf and my size are over 100 dollars and I never get to get the ones I want because wide calf has limited styles.With dream pairs I can pick and choose and I know they will be comfortable. I want these in every color now. I purchased black and they are so soft and comfortable. I can't wait to wear them this season.Read more",
            "I was pleasantly surprised at how nice these boots look! I have a wider upper calf and was hesitant about ordering but they fit perfectly. True to size and very comfy, I love them!Read more",

            "I was unsure about ordering these boots as the calf bit looked quite wide, however I read all the reviews and on the strength of that went ahead. I was / am NOT disappointed. I usually wear a size 7 but ordered a 7.5 and they fit perfectly. They are so comfortable and look stylish and although a little loose just under the knee they don't sag. I thought the price was very reasonable .I have no intention of wearing them out in the rain because the suede looks good and they might get ruined. You can clean with a suede brush and I've even worn them with a pair of socks if the weather was very cold and didn't suffer with cold feet. Was tempted to buy another pair in a different colour.......depends if there are some left.Read more"
